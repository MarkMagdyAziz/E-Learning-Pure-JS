            <p class="para">next we’re going to look at the llamas, but actually here we have four different animals which are all from South America and all related to camels. Llamas, which you
                have probably heard of, over here. And over there alpacas, vicuñas and guanacos.Llamas and alpacas are both domesticated animals and vicuñas and guanacos are wild. Llamas are the
                biggest animal – they can grow up to 1.8 metres tall and in the past they were used to carry things. Llamas
                are very sociable animals and live together in groups, in herds.</p>
                <span class="para" style="color: green">Don’t they spit at people, though?</span>
            <p class="para">Well, yes, they can. All members of the camelid family sometimes spit. You don’t want to mistreat a
                llama; it might even spit some of the contents of its stomach at you.</p>
            <p class="para">: But if you treat them properly they are not likely to. They respond well to being trained and they are
                usually gentle and curious.
                OK, over here we have the alpacas. As you can see, they are smaller than the llamas. They’ve got smaller
                faces and they always look as though they are smiling. Look at this one’s face.</p>
            <p class="para">The alpaca is famous for its wool, which is softer and warmer than sheep’s wool. There’s a big
                demand for alpaca wool from the fashion industry.
                Right, next to the alpacas we have the vicuñas. As I said before, these animals are wild and they are
                thought to be the ancestors of the alpacas.</p>
